# Cervical Cancer Prediction  🩺🔬

Cervical cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, particularly affecting women. Early detection plays a crucial role in successful treatment and improved outcomes. However, traditional screening methods may have limitations in accuracy and accessibility, leading to missed diagnoses or delayed interventions.

The goal of this project is to develop an advanced prediction model using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to accurately detect cervical cancer in women. The model aims to leverage demographic and clinical data to identify potential risks and enable early intervention strategies. The ultimate objective is to improve healthcare outcomes by providing a reliable and efficient tool for cervical cancer screening and risk assessment.
